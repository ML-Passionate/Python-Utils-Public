* Scatter Plot:
If 'Y' or 'y' exists, the scatter plot will have points colored based on the values in that column.
If 'Y' or 'y' does not exist, the scatter plot will be a standard plot without classification.

* Saved Files:
The normalized data will be saved as data-normalized.csv.
The standardized data will be saved as data-standardized.csv.

* Make sure to replace 'field1', 'field2', etc., with the actual field names from your dataset. Also, ensure that the necessary Python libraries are installed in your environment. You can install them using pip if they are not already installed.
